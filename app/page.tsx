                  Claudia Valeria, fondly known as <strong>Clio</strong>, aged 22, is a prominent member of the esteemed Valeria gens in the Seventh Republic. Her family boasts a lineage of academic excellence, with her father currently serving as the head of the academy. Through generations, her ancestors have held influential positions such as consuls and cardinals, and their contributions to science have earned them recognition as saints.
                  </p><p>
                  Despite being born into this prestigious family, Claudia has always stood out as a trailblazer in her own right. Renowned as the most accomplished young scientist of her time, she possesses a brilliant mind and a passion for pushing boundaries. However, prior to the events chronicled in the novel, Claudia had purposefully chosen to distance herself from the realms of academia and public service.
                  </p><p>
                  Instead, she found solace in a life of leisure and indulgence, often becoming entangled in scandalous tales that circulated throughout the republic. Her rebellious behavior served as a form of protest against the existing societal norms and expectations, challenging the status quo at every turn.

                  Aurelia Fabia, fondly known as <strong>Fia</strong>, aged 27, possesses a shrewd and purposeful nature, accompanied by unwavering honesty. Born into the illustrious lineage of one of the Republic&apos;s founding families, her ancestry holds a complex legacy. Despite the family&apos;s republican roots, two notable figures from their lineage have been regarded as the most formidable adversaries the Republic has ever faced.
                  </p><p>
                  The first, Titus Fabius Elder, held an unparalleled position of favor and influence in the court of the first emperor of the new era. Known for his unwavering loyalty to the emperor, Titus Fabius possessed the authority to act with impunity, his actions unconstrained by traditional boundaries.
                  </p><p>
                  The second, Titus&apos; grandson, known as Titus Fabius Cruentus, ascended to the throne as an emperor. His reign was marked by a reputation for tyranny and cruelty, leaving a dark imprint on the annals of history. Before the events chronicled in the novel, Fia harbored an ardent aspirationâ€”to become the Republic&apos;s most exceptional and just consul, a feat that would redeem her family&apos;s tarnished reputation and restore honor to their name.
